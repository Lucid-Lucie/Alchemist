# Alchemist's Combat

*Apply potions to weaponry!*

## Enchantments

New enchantments has been seen on swords and axes. ***Brewing*** is a powerful enchantment that lets you put potions on your swords and axes, the level of the enchantment determines how many potions you can apply to your weapon. ***Proficiency*** enhances the skill of applying potions, the greater the enchantment the more uses you will get out of your applied potion.

## Effects

New mob effects can also be brewed in this mod. ***Life Taking*** works like instant damage but wounds all mobs alive and undead. ***Soul Draining*** also works on all mobs and is similar to the poison effect. ***Thieving*** can make Illagers and Piglins drop some of their valued loot that they are carrying. ***Displacement*** can teleport away armor from the creature that has been affected by it.

## Campfires

There has come a new use of campfires in this mod. To apply a potion to your weapon of choice you need a weapon in your main hand that is enchanted with at least the first tier of brewing, a potion of your choice in the off hand, and a lit campfire to combine it all. If you venture out in the nether do notice that a soul campfire will bring more uses than your ordinary campfire.

## Datapacks

The weaponry that can apply the brewing enchantment is customizable using item tags in a datapack. The Thieving potion effect is also configurable using datapacks.

## Recipes

The way to gather the new potions will be changed in a future update, but as of now the recipes are as follows.

* **Thieving:** Golden Apple with Awkward potion.
* **Displacement:** Ender Pearl with Awkward potion.
* **Life Taking:** Poppy with Awkward Potion.
* **Soul Draining: ** Soul Sand with Awkward Potion.
* **Levitation:** Fermented Spider Eye with Potion of Slow Falling.
