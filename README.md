# Alchemist's Combat 2

*A rework of Alchemist's Combat.*

**How to get started.**
This mod brings potions to your swords and axes to aid in the endless war against vile creatures. To bring potions upon your sword or axe you will need a new enchantment called brewing.  With the new enchantment active you can put a potion of your choice in the off hand and your tool in your main hand and then right click a campfire to apply the potion effect on to your tool. This works on both normal campfire and soul campfire.

**Two new enchantments can be found on swords and axes:**

* **Brewing:** This enchantment actually makes it possible to have potions applied to your tools. **Brewing I** lets you have 1 active potion while **Brewing II** lets you have two active potions at the same time.
* **Proficiency:** When you apply a potion to your tool it will have an amount of uses with default being 16 uses per potion. **Proficiency** makes the amount of uses higher and with a **Proficiency III** enchantment and a bit of luck you can get a maximum of 64 uses per potion.

**The mod also comes with new potion effects which are:**

* **Thieving:** Drops Emeralds from Villages and Illagers, also drops golden items from Piglins and Zombified Piglins. (*Brewed with a Golden Apple*)
* **Displacement:** Affected mob has a chance to drop armor and held items. (*Brewed with an Ender Pearl*)
* **Soul Draining:** Works like poison but works on all mobs. (*Brewed with a Soul Sand*)
* **Life Taking:** Works like instant damage but works on all mobs. (*Brewed with a Poppy*)
* **Levitation:** Not new but now has a recipe. (*Brewed by having a Fermented Spider Eye on Potions of Slow Falling*)
